# Provider Extension Guide

PolyTalk is intentionally service-oriented rather than tied to one hosted
provider. The current extension model is configuration-first:

- Use OpenAI-compatible STT, translation, or TTS endpoints when possible.
- Keep provider credentials in `.env`.
- Keep application behavior in `config/config.yaml`.
- Add or replace service classes only when a provider does not fit the existing
  HTTP/WebSocket contracts.

There is no runtime plugin loader yet. Custom providers are integrated by
implementing the base service interfaces in `app/services/base.py` and wiring
the implementation into the application service layer.

## Service Contracts

The main contracts are:

- `BaseTranscriptionService.stream_transcribe(...)`
- `BaseTranslationService.translate(...)`
- `BaseTTSService.synthesize(...)`

Implementations return these result objects:

- `TranscriptionResult`
- `TranslationResult`
- `TTSResult`

Keep provider-specific request payloads, authentication, retry behavior, and
response parsing inside the provider service class. The pipeline should receive
normalized result objects and should not need to know provider-specific details.

## STT Providers

The default `WhisperService` expects a WebSocket STT provider.

Configured keys:

```yaml
whisper:
  enabled: true
  mock_mode: false
  base_url: "${WHISPER_BASE_URL}"
  ws_endpoint: "${WHISPER_WS_ENDPOINT}"
  ping_interval_seconds: null
  ping_timeout_seconds: null
  max_reconnect_attempts: 3
  reconnect_delay_seconds: 2
```

Expected stream shape:

- The app sends raw `16 kHz`, mono, signed `int16` PCM bytes.
- The app may first send a JSON language hint: `{"language": "de"}`.
- The STT provider returns JSON messages with `text`, optional `language`,
  optional `is_final`, optional `metrics`, and optional `error`.

For a compatible custom STT service, deploy it separately and set:

```env
WHISPER_BASE_URL=https://stt.example.com
WHISPER_WS_ENDPOINT=/v1/stream/transcriptions
WHISPER_API_KEY=optional-token
```

If the provider uses a different wire format, create a new implementation of
`BaseTranscriptionService` that translates provider responses into
`TranscriptionResult`.

## Translation Providers

The default `TranslationService` targets OpenAI-compatible chat completions.

Configured keys:

```yaml
translation:
  enabled: true
  mock_mode: false
  base_url: "${TRANSLATION_BASE_URL}"
  endpoint: "/v1/chat/completions"
  api_key: "${TRANSLATION_API_KEY}"
  model: "${TRANSLATION_MODEL}"
  temperature: 0.0
  max_tokens: "${TRANSLATION_MAX_TOKENS}"
  system_prompt: "..."
```

Use this path for OpenAI, vLLM, and other providers that accept:

```json
{
  "model": "polytalk-translation",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "..."}
  ],
  "temperature": 0.0,
  "max_tokens": 240
}
```

The response must include `choices[0].message.content`.

For non-compatible providers, implement `BaseTranslationService.translate()` and
return `TranslationResult(text=..., success=True)` on success. Do not put
provider-specific prompt rules in the pipeline; keep them in the provider
service or config.

## TTS Providers

The default `TTSService` supports:

- `provider: "piper"` for the local Piper service.
- Any other provider value currently falls back to the OpenAI speech API path.

Configured keys:

```yaml
tts:
  enabled: true
  mock_mode: false
  provider: "piper"
  base_url: "${TTS_BASE_URL}"
  voice: "en_GB-jenny_dioco-medium"
  timeout_seconds: 10
  default_voices:
    ar: "ar_JO-kareem-medium"
    de: "de_DE-karlsson-low"
    en: "en_GB-jenny_dioco-medium"
    es: "es_ES-davefx-medium"
    fr: "fr_FR-siwis-medium"
    hi: "hi_IN-priyamvada-medium"
    it: "it_IT-paola-medium"
    ml: "ml_IN-arjun-medium"
    nl: "nl_NL-ronnie-medium"
    ro: "ro_RO-mihai-medium"
    ru: "ru_RU-denis-medium"
    tr: "tr_TR-dfki-medium"
    zh: "zh_CN-huayan-medium"
```

Piper-compatible providers should expose:

- `GET /voices`
- `POST /` with `text`, `voice`, and optional provider parameters.
- Binary audio content in the HTTP response body.

Custom TTS services should implement `BaseTTSService.synthesize()` and return a
`TTSResult` with either:

- `audio_path` plus `audio_url` for files written under `media/output`, or
- an error result with `success=False` and a useful `error` message.

The frontend plays URLs emitted by the pipeline, so providers that return audio
bytes must still save or expose those bytes through an HTTP-accessible URL.

## Configuration Rules

- `.env` is for deployment-specific values: API keys, base URLs, model names,
  Docker model settings, ports, and CORS origins.
- `config/config.yaml` is for application behavior: mock mode, endpoints,
  prompts, voices, media storage, and timeout/flush settings.
- `config/config.yaml.example` and `.env.example` should stay safe for public
  repositories. Never place real tokens, private URLs, or model registry secrets
  in example files.

## Testing a Provider

Before wiring a provider into a live deployment:

1. Set the relevant service to `mock_mode: false`.
2. Run unit tests:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

3. Run the matching benchmark script from `tools/benchmarks/`.
4. Run a full pipeline benchmark if STT, translation, or TTS timing changed.
5. Test microphone input and tab audio separately. Tab audio is cleaner and may
   hide microphone-specific STT issues.

## Current Limits

- Provider selection is not dynamically loaded from entry points or a plugin
  directory.
- The pipeline currently instantiates the built-in service classes.
- Deeper provider swaps may require a small code change in the service wiring.

For open-source deployments, prefer compatibility adapters around existing
provider protocols before adding new pipeline behavior.
